  Trying to access an uninitialized session state variable '${propertyName}'.
  autogenerated file path '${normalizedDestinationPath}' may not be absolute.
  autogenerated file path '${normalizedDestinationPath}' must start with 'project/'

  unable to find managed section inside .gitignore
  refusing to write to a file that is not marked as autogenerated.
